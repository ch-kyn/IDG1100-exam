# Exam for IDG1100
The main assignment of our final grade (60%) for "Web Fundamentals" (**IDG1100**). The task involved scraping coordinates of all Norwegian municipalities from Wikipedia, displaying general info regarding them on a webpage, and using a Weather API to show weather data forcasted at 12AM the next day by querying a page for each place listed,

## Notes
I decided to track files in 'tmp' folder, that have been used to check the different stages of the process, and
'places.txt' in the 'data' folder in case running the deployment script would take too much time. Delete all those files if you want to run the script via 'deploy.sh'.
